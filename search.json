    "text": "Managing Excess Generation in California.\nReducing output from renewables undermines environmental goals\nMeanwhile, traditional power supply must remain online to meet morning ramps or to provide energy if the wind stops flowing or clouds cover solar panels.\nTechnical and contractual barriers make it difficult to turn generators on & off like a light switch as utilities continuously balance Supply and Deman in Real-Time.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAISO Offers Energy Imbalance Market (EIM) to other utilities in the Western States.\n\nThis real-time market increases flexibility by allowing access to Clean Energy from one area to be used in another.\n\nOversupply is also helped by having different types of renewables located across a wide geographic are using Energy Storage to capture Excess energy + Adopting Time of Use Rate (TOU) to incentivize efficient consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rate you pay for electricity varies depending on the Tim eof day you use it.\nOn TOU plans you pay more for electricity during peak hours when electricity demand is higher, like in the evening when people return home from work.\nTo balance for these higher electricity prices, you pay less for electricity druing off-peak hours such as late at night when people are sleeping and overall demand for electricity is lower.\nYou can save money on your electiricy bills by adjusting your daily electricity consumption habits such as running your dish washer in the morning instead of right after dinner, or by charging your electric vehicle overnight.\nUnder a TOU plan, Solar Power producers’ credit for excess solar electricity sent to the grid vary depending on the time of the day.\nCredit generated during off-peak hours will be worth less than a credit cents of the grid during peak hours.\nMany homeowners with TOU rates consider pairing their solar system with batteries.\nThis allows you to store power during peak hours rather than paying for expensive electricity from the grid.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Storage Move Energy Through Time\nElectricity can be stored directly in coils and capacitors.\nIndirect electrical storage requires electricity to be converted to some form of mechanical, chemical or kinetic energy prior to storage. It then is converted back to electricity at some point in time for use.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 1749, Benjamin Franklin first used the term “battery” to describe a set of linked capacitors he used for his experiments with electricity.\nThese capacitors were panels of glass coated with metal on each surface.\nThese capacitors were charged with a static generator and discharged by touching metal to thier electrode.\nLinking them together in a “battery” gave a stronger discharge.\nOriginally having the generic meaning of “a group of two or more similar objects functioning together”, as in an artillery battery, of Franklin’s capacitors.\nThe term came to be used for voltaic piles and similar devices in which many electrochemical cells were connected together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy Storage Technologies Diagram\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPumped Storage Projects\n\n\n\n\n\nPumped Storage System\n\n\nNotes: Open-loop systems use a free flowing source of water for either the upper or lower reservoir. For a closed-loop pumped storage hydropower, neither the upper reservoir nor the lower reservoir is located on a dammed stream.\n\n\nPotential Energy The potential theoretical energy in a volume of elevated water can be calculated as\n\\[ E = \\rho V g H \\] in KW\n\\[ E = {{\\rho V g H} \\over 3600} \\] in kWh\nPower from Falling Water\nThe power available from falling water can be expressed as:\n\\[ P = \\rho gHW \\eta \\] in kW\nH is the net head (m).\nV the storage capacity (\\(m^3\\)).\ng is the acceleration due to gravity (\\(m/s^2\\))\n\\(\\rho\\) is the density of the water (\\(kg/m^3\\))\nE - energy (J)\nQ = flow rate (\\(m^3/s\\))\nEfficiency \\(\\eta\\) = efficiency (generally in the range of 0,.75 to 0.95)\n\n\n\n\n\n[!(compressed_air_energy_storage_system.png)]\n\n\n\n\\[ E_{FES} = {{1}\\over2} J_{F} \\omega_{mF}^2 \\]\n\\(E_{FES}\\) is the energy stored by the FES system (J), \\(J_F\\) is the moment of inertia (H) of the FES system (electrical machine inertia plus flywheel rotor inertia), \\(\\omega_{mF}\\) is the flywheel rotor mechanical speed (rad/s).\nFES systems can be classified into two types: - Conventional low speed FES units, which use steel as the flywheel material and rotates below 10,000 rpm - High-speed FES units, which use advanced high-strength composite materials for the flywheel, such as carbon-fiber, and rotates up to 100,000 rpm\n\n\n\nThe flywheel has fallen off may people’s radar since the industry’s leader, Beacon Power, filed for bankruptcy in 2011.\nThe company was revived shortly after, and other competitors joined the market since.\nA flywheel battery stores electric energy by converting it into kinetic energy using a motor to spin a rotor. The motor also works as a generator; the kinetic energy can be converted back to electric energy when needed.\nEarly flywheel batteries were bad at storing energy for long periods.\nFlywheels at the time were used more for short-term energy storage, providing five-to-ten-minute backup power in data centers.\n\n\n\n\n\nImprovement in material to enable high speed spins.\nNew generation of motor-generator to reduce system energy losses.\nReduce mechanical energy losses as waste heat by using passive magnetic bearing to holed the rotor in equilibrium without using external control that consumes additional energy.\nThe use of the high-temperature superconductor (-196 C) as a bearing not only allows the bearing to lift a very heavy rotor (Revterra’s commercial-scale rotor will weigh seven tons) but it also cuts energy losses due to the bearing’s inherent ability to trap the magnetic field that holds the rotor in place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuper Capacitor Energy Storage (SCES)\n\n\n\nKey difference of the super capacitor is its structure of liquid electrolyte and porous electrodes (activated carbon material), which creates an extremely high specific surface area (hundres of m2/g) compared to the conventional electrode structure.\nVery high capacitance per unit of volume, which can be from hundreds to thousands times larger than conventional electrolytic capacitors.\n\n\\[ C = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_r {{A}\\over D} \\]\nA is the area of overlap of the two plates, D is the separation between the plates.\n\n\\(\\epsilon_0\\) the absolute permittivity of

refrigerating system (cryostat, vacuum pumps, cryogenic refrigerator, tanks, etc.), the electronic power conditioning (conversion) system and the control system.\nTwo main superconducting magnet topologies in a SMES system: solenoidal and toroidal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLithium-Ion Batteries\n\n\n\nThe device charges when lithium ions move from a negative electrod to a positive electrode and discharges by the movement of ions in the reverse direction.\nNumerous difference chemistries make up the family of lithium-ion batteries, including but not limited to lithium iron-phosphate, lithium manganese-spinel, and nickel-manganese-cobalt.\nLithium-ion batteries have a range of power-to-energy ratios depending on the chemistry and specific design of the battery system.\nCompared to other electrochemical energy sotrage technologies, lithium-ion batteries are energy and power dense.\nDue to their smaller size and low operating and maintenance needs, the obstacles to implementation are limited.\nLithium-ion batteries are already commercially available for use in personal electronics and various other applications and are available for use on the electric grid.\n\n\n\n\nThere is a trend to reduce or eliminate the amount of cobalt in cathodes for ethical and cost reasons.\nMost of the world’s cobalt is mined in the Congo which has been heavily criticized for its unethical and environmentally damging labor and mining practices.\nHigh cobalt batteries also have lower energy density which is not attractive to the EV sector.\nShift in industry to NMC and NCA li-ion batteries with smaller proportions of cobalt, and lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells which contain no cobalt.\nAlthough LFP cells have lower energy density, they have gained in popularity for use in vehicles and home storage because of their increased safety, and reliance on iron which is more abundant than cobalt.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently, lithium-ion energy storage systems are maxing out at around four hours.\nIt is expected to go out to six or maybe even eight hours, but the technology does suffer from diminishing returns and less favorable economics at longer durations.\nLithium-ion energy storage systesm are well suited to help with second-to-second system balancing, renewables ramping and providing peak power services\nManufacturing at scale has quickly reduced cost and increased the energy density of Li-ion batteries, making long-lasting portable electronic device and EVs possible.\nExpect half the passenger cars sold globally in 2032 to be electric.\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch into Li-ion batteries is focused on improving energy density, size, and safety while reducing cost.\nIn 2020, Tesla discussed several aspects of improvement including the introduction of silicon to batteries as part of their strategy.\nSolid-state batteries replace the liquid electrolyte with a solid material.\nThis could increase energy density and durability while removing the most flammable element of Li-ion batteries, making them ideal for high-risk applications like pacemakers.\nHowever, solid-state Li-ion batteries are currently much more expensive than traditional liquid-electrolyte batteries.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlternative storage methods for low-cost, long duration storage are coming.\nThese include non-battery storage and novel battery chemistries.\nWhile lithium may be the best battery chemistry for transportation and mobile applications, these new batteries are especially useful for stationary applications like grid scale energy storage.\nFlow batteries are a type of long-duration battery technology that work by flowing an electrolyte through a series of plates.\nThe fluid volume dictates the energy, and the electrode plates dictate the power.\nThere are a variety of flow battery startups at various stages of commercialization.\nNotable chemistries are vanadium redox, iron flow, and zinc-based.\nThe difficulty with many of these systems is the movement of reactive liquids or liquid/solid slurries which challenge the pumps, valves, and seals needed to move these reactants.\nCompared with lithium-ion batteries flow chemistries also have lower round-trip efficiencies.\nThese new battery technologies have yet to overcome their design challenges and demonstrate commercial viability.\nFor them to be successful in stationary energy storage, they must first demonstrate that lower USD/kWh installed costs are possible.\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely that EVs will move away from Li-ion battery technology in the foreseeable future.\nThe energy density of Li-Ion batteries align well with mileage needs and notable advancements, like solid electrolyte designs and the adoption of new anode chemistries, are coming to production.\nExpect EV adoption to increase as costs continue to fall and vehicle range is extended.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrogen Energy Storage System with Fuel Cell Technology and Electrolyzer\n\n\n\nFuel cells work like batteries, but they do not run down or need recharging.\nThey produce electricity and heat as long as fuel is supplied.\nA fuel cell consists of an anode and a cathode sandwiched around an electrolyte.\nIn a hydrogen fuel cell, a catalyst at the anode separates hydrogen molecules into protons and electrons, which take different paths to the cathode.\nThe electrons go through an external circuit, creating a flow of electricity.\nThe protons migrate through the electrolyte to the cathode, where they unite with oxygen and the electrons to produce water and heat.\n\n\n\n\nGreen hydrogen produced offshore, in which electrolyzers are powered by offshore wind.\nFalling costs of offshore wind and electrolyzers would improve the economics of such projects."

For example, ERCOT, which is a small interconnection and more vulnerable to frequency excursions, now requires wind generators to provide inertial response, which helps keep a system stable in the initial moments after a disturbance.\n\n\nLow capacity factor\nAvailability of the underlying energy resource limits the run-time of the plant\nExisting conventional generators could be needed to meet demand, but run less than originally anticipated, affecting cost recovery.\nCapacity payments or markets, potentially tied to flexible performance, could ensure sufficient cost recovery. The potential for stranded assets is not unique to variable RE, and can occur whenever generation with lower marginal costs have reduced the market competitiveness of nuclear plants, contributing to recent retirements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable and uncertain power output determined by local weather conditions.\nConventional generators, such as coal and gas plants, are considered dispatchable because they can more easily change their power output (both up and down) to meet changes in load.\nPV power has a natural challenge associated wit hits diurnal cycle.\nThis makes the power output between individual PV generators very well correlated, with large amounts of energy in relatively small windows of time.\nWind energy also has a diurnal cycle. In many locations within the United States, there tends to be more wind energy produced during nighttime hours than during daytime hours.\nThere can be times when there is too much supply, and the curtailment makes sense for economic or reliability reasons.\nRequires greater grid flexibility to accommodate the changes in generation.\n\n\n\n\nCapacity factors measure how intensively a generating unit runs\nIt is a measure of how much energy is produced by a plant compared to its maximum output.\nA capacity factor of 100% means a generating unit is operating all the time.\nIt may also be expressed as the ratio of average output to maximum output over a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1000 MW capacity, produces 648,000 MWh in 30 days a month.\nThe number of MWhs that could have been produced had the plant been operating at full capacity = 1000MW X 30 days X 24 hours/day = 720,000.\n\n\\[\n648,000 MW*h \\over {(30 days) * (24 hours/day) * (1000 MW)} = 0.9 \\approx 90%\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nOut of service or operating at reduced output for part of the time due to equipment failure or routine maintenance.\n\nBase load plants have lowest costs per unit of electricity because they are designed for maximum efficiency and operating continuously at high output\nGeothermal, nuclear, coal, bioenergy plants burn solid material —- always operate as baseload.\n\nOutput is curtailed because electricity is not needed or because price of electricity is too low to make production economical.\n\nPeaking power plants. Operate for only few hours. Their electricity is relatively expensive\n\nWind farms are variable, due to the natural variability of the wind.\n\nFor a wind farm, the capacity factor is mostly determined by the availability of wind. Transmission line capacity and electricity demand also affect the capacity factor.\n\nSolar energy is variable because of the daily rotation of the earth, seasonal changes, and because of cloud cover.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid of the future will have many more inverter-based generators and be much more distributed than the current power system, which is dominated by central-station synchronous generators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe system frequency and voltages are tightly regulated through a combination of fast-acting closed-loop controller at each machine.\nThe turbine system and rotating components inside each machine exhibit mechanical inertia, capable of storing kinetic energy in this rotating mass.\nEnergy can be extracted or absorbed into these rotating masses during system disturbances, an interconnected system of machines is able to withstand fluctuations in net load and generation.\n\nA net excess, or deficiency, in generation delivers energy into, or extracts energy from, the rotating masses and subsequently leads to an increased, or decreased, system frequency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnitl about 2003, DFIGs, like fixed-speed WTGs, were unable to ride through faults causing the wind farm terminal voltage to fall below about 70% of the nominal voltage.\n\n\n\n\nInertia\nActive Power Control\nReactive Power Control\nFault Ride Through\n\n\n\n\n\nVRE is capable of providing any type of operating reserves;\nHowever, the challenge is that accurate resource forecasts are needed at different time horizons to ensure the availability of such reserves from wind and solar generation.\nEnergy storage can also be used to provide additional reserves and help correct possible imbalances due to forecast errors.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrid Friendly Wind and Solar Plants\n\nFault-ride through\nVoltage regulation\nPrimary Frequency Response\nSynthetic Inertia\n\nSuperior Operation\n\nHugely improved forecasting (fewer surprises)\nSituational awareness; avoided risks\n\nLocal and selective transmission"

For example, ERCOT, which is a small interconnection and more vulnerable to frequency excursions, now requires wind generators to provide inertial response, which helps keep a system stable in the initial moments after a disturbance.\n\n\nLow capacity factor\nAvailability of the underlying energy resource limits the run-time of the plant\nExisting conventional generators could be needed to meet demand, but run less than originally anticipated, affecting cost recovery.\nCapacity payments or markets, potentially tied to flexible performance, could ensure sufficient cost recovery. The potential for stranded assets is not unique to variable RE, and can occur whenever generation with lower marginal costs have reduced the market competitiveness of nuclear plants, contributing to recent retirements."

    "text": "3.1 Toward a Global Green Smart Microgrid\n\nDistributed generation has some disadvantages, such as poor controllability and strong volatility, which make renewable energy generation unable to provide stable outputs, such that the penetration rate of renewable energy is limited.\nMicrogrid\n\nproposed to increase the controllability and mitigate the uncertainty of distributed energy resources\ncan operate in two ways: the off-grid and grid-connected modes\nequivalent to a single controlled unit from the viewpoint of the power grid, which can provide power grid support, improve energy efficiency, save energy, and reduce consumption\nfor the users, it can meet the power supply safety and power quality requirements\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Recovery and Resiliency\n\nIn a microgrid that operates in on-grid mode, when the electrical equipment in the microgrid goes wrong, it should be ensured that the microgrid can continue operating safely and steadily after the fault device is cut off.\nOn the premise of reliable location and removal of the fault device, the microgid should continue operating reliably after being disconnected from the distribution system when a fault occurs in the distribution system.\nThe protection includes two aspects internal protection of the microgrid and the tie line protection.\n\nInternal protection of the microgrid means that when a fault occurs within the microgrid, the proteciton system can quickly identify, locate, and cut off the fault, thereby ensuring the safe and stable operation.\n\ninternal protection strategy\n\nlow-voltage protection strategy is mainly used when the microgrid operates in the off-grid mode because it can deal with the low-short-circuit capacity brought by the off-grid operation. It is suitable for a microgrid that can be divided into multiple protection areas, and each protection area is composed of a DG and load that can achieve power balance.\ncurrent-differential protection strategy can be used in both the on-grid and off grid modes, and it is mainly used to protect the feeders in the microgrid. It needs to install current transformers at both ends of each feeder to measure the current through the two ends of the line. It compares the measurements of both ends of the feeders.\n\ntie line protection strategy\n\ndetermine if the microgrid operates in off-grid or on-grid mode\ndetermine the microgrid protection strategy\n\n\n\n\n3.1.2 Off-Grid Mode\n\nCharacteristics of off-grid mode:\n\nload is supplied by DGs\nindependent microgrid is separated from the distribution system\nit can continue to operate without the power provided by the distribution system.\nThe voltage and frequency remain within the allowable range.\n\nThere are two control methods: master-slave control and peer-to-peer control (droop control)\n\nMaster-slave control refers to the fact that, when the microgrid operates in off-grid mode, it is necessary to choose a DG from the microgrid as the master power source, and the master power source should maintain the voltage and frequency stability of the microgrid.\ndroop control is a DG inverter control method that enables the output of the DGs to be automatically distributed according to their droop characteristics. Through the specific design of the logical control strategies, the DG inverter can obtain the static droop characteristics."
